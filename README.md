# Recipes

A fun little website with some of my favorite recipes [Here](https://iscrol.github.io/Recipes/).

This my first time using HTML and I'm trying to get the hang
of it's features.

In this project I hope to create a main page with links to other pages.
I want these pages additional pages to have some of my favorite
recipes. Additonally, I want to add images of my favorite recipes.
Furthermore, I hope to add a an unordered list of ingridients
and an ordered list of steps. Lastly on the main page I hope to
provide a brief description of the dishes and all of their glory.
